# Masters-Projects

Domain Adaption and Sentiment Analysis on Reviews in E-commerce Sites
Built ALEXNET inspired Convolution Neural Network model, with 85% accuracy, using Python to predict customer rating of new products on Amazon Marketplace. Model was trained using Transfer Learning techniques and NLP for text mining.

DDoS detection and Mitigation in Software Defined Network (SDN)
Implemented feature for early detection of anomalies in packets and packet flow rate on Open Switch, with 80% detection accuracy, using Machine Learning models (Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine). Implemented rule-based automated mitigation feature.

Event-based News Summarization
Implemented a project to summarize news stories from different sources by forming Event graphs for Information Retrieval, using Natural Language Processing (NLP)and Rule-based models.

LendKart â€“ Lend and Buy goods under the same roof
Designed and implemented an online marketplace (Android Mobile App) using Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework and Django with database hosted on AWS EC2 instance.

Learning of Datastreams with Gradually evolved classes
Implemented a solution inspired from IEEE RP-Online Ensemble Learning of Data Streams with Gradually Evolved Classes (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7401075) - "Class evolution, the phenomenon of class emergence and disappearance, is an important research topic for data stream mining For example, new topics frequently appear on Twitter and outdated topics are forgotten with time. Besides, old topics, e.g., topics on festivals, may also become popular again. Such phenomena can also be observed from other types of data streams, such as the click-through data of news or advertisements since the interests of clients may change over time. In some literature, class evolution is also called class-incremental learning or concept evolution."
